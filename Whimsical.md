[Whismical](https://whimsical.com)  is a SaaS aimed to keep teams aligned by providing collaboration templates and examples.  Designed to be live updated and create discourse/discussion across remote teams and synchronous conversations.

It appears interesting as it is trying to become the "IDE" of product teams.  ie, shift from using many different bespoke tools scattered across different technologies/folders and provide good-enough tools together.  By bringing artifacts together, the narrative across roles is more transparent and connected.  ie, designs, business workflows, architecture diagrams are more connected.
