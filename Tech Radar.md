Welcome to the Tech Radar Repository.   Each radar contains notes on a particular theme.

# Summary

In  product development, currently interested in the swing away from Agile dogma / weaponization and tooling to help teams collaborate.

[Whimsical](Whimsical.md) appears interesting as it is trying to become the "IDE" of product teams.  ie, shift from using many different bespoke tools scattered across different technologies/folders and provide good-enough tools together.  By bringing artifacts together, the narrative across roles is more transparent and connected.  ie, designs, business workflows, architecture diagrams are more connected.

[[Arcade]] and [[Storylane]] are demo platforms designed to help sales teams with prospective conversations.

 ring:  assess, trail, adopt, hold
 quadrant:  platform, technique, tool, framework
----

<Title>.md          # Title in blip on the radar

First paragraph     # Appear as tooltips / quick view
