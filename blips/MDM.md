JumpCloud - Good price, easy growth path as you scale to get things like SSO, password management
Kandji - integration with Vanta for SOC2 and the built-in EDR. We were all-Mac, and focused on desktop not mobile.  Rollout was very easy and the product is solid.

Jamf (too complicated)
Mosyle (unreliable)
