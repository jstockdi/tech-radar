    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://whimsical.com\">Whismical</a>  is a SaaS aimed to keep teams aligned by providing collaboration templates and examples.  Designed to be live updated and create discourse/discussion across remote teams and synchronous conversations.</p>\n<p>It appears interesting as it is trying to become the &quot;IDE&quot; of product teams.  ie, shift from using many different bespoke tools scattered across different technologies/folders and provide good-enough tools together.  By bringing artifacts together, the narrative across roles is more transparent and connected.  ie, designs, business workflows, architecture diagrams are more connected.</p>\n"
